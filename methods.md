DNA was isolated from ctendia tissue using NEED METHOD - CLAIRE'S NOTEBOOK?

Genomic DNA (2750ng) was fragmented using a Bioruptor (Diagenode Inc.). Shearing was performed in 0.5μL snap cap tube, in a volume of 80μL. The DNA was sheared using the following settings: 30 cycles of 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off. Fragmentation was assessed via 1% agarose, 1x TAE gel, stained with ethidium bromide. Average fragment size was estimated to be 200bp (see GitHub repo for gel image).

Methylated DNA enrichment was performed using the MethylMiner Methylated DNA Enrichment Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with the following modifications. Each sample received 25μL of Dynabeads M-280 (10μg of input DNA) and 15μL of MBD-Biotin Protein (7μL/μg of input DNA). A single elution with 2000mM sodium chloride was performed. Samples were resuspended in 29μL of nuclease-free water. Samples were quantified, in duplicate, using 2.5 μL of each sample with the Quant-IT BS Kit (Invitrogen) with a BioTek plate reader.

Bisulfite conversion was performed using Methylamp DNA Modification Kit (Epigentek), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were eluted in 10μL of Solution R6.
